## How to edit? What does this mean? Help?
If you modify the code and use the modified code in a public/commmercial free/paid/subscribtion based distribution, E.g. downloadable application, dependency, etc. You have to make the modified code publicly available in a readable source code form so that the public can use it and potentially benefit from it i.e. Open Source.
This does NOT apply if you keep the modified code private, E.g. personal, organisation, company, etc.

**TL;DR** Modified code has to be public
